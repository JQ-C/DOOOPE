# Project Reason
- DOOOPE keyboard was created to use Redragon low profile switch as a cheap alternative to the Low profile choc switches used in many Low-pro boards, hence the name "DOOOPE" that sounds like dupe.
- Another decision is to use off the shelf components and the cheapest at the category.
- This keyboard also used [Ergogen V4]() to prototype the layout and later finished in Kicad.

# Future Revision / To-Do
- Make it a reversible PCB to reduce cost
- Add support for both MX and Redragon Switch
